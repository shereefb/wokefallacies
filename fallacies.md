1. Disparity ⇒ discrimination (single-cause fallacy)
   Treating unequal group outcomes as proof of bias, rather than a possible *hypothesis* among many. Sowell calls this an “invincible” assumption and shows how multiple factors can generate gaps; economists warn policy built on single-cause stories often backfires. ([Hoover Institution][1])

2. “Lived experience” as an epistemic trump card
   Standpoint theory rightly says knowledge is socially situated and marginalized voices can have insight—but elevating testimony to *infallibility* collapses evidence standards and blocks adjudication of disagreements. Use testimony as *data*, not *decider*. ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][2])

3. Motte-and-bailey shift
   Advance a strong claim (“X is violence / all disparities are racist”), then retreat to a trivial claim when challenged (“words can *feel* harmful / some disparities involve racism”), only to re-assert the strong claim later. Shackel named this maneuver. ([PhilPapers][3])

4. Concept creep & safetyism
   Definitions of harm expand (bullying → microaggression → “unsafe speech”), so more things count as injury, justifying stronger controls. Haidt/Lukianoff warn “safetyism” can undermine resilience; Haslam mapped this drift empirically. ([Heterodox Academy][4])

5. “Speech = violence” conflation
   A moral intuition that harmful words are *like* violence becomes a policy claim that they *are* violence, inviting coercive remedies normally reserved for force. Even campus ethicists who sympathize with the intuition caution against this equivalence. ([Harvard Gazette][5])

6. Equity–equality swap
   Using “equity” (outcome-focused) and “equality” (process/access-focused) interchangeably. This muddies goals and metrics; even pro-equity orgs stress keeping the terms distinct to avoid bad policy design. ([Inside Higher Ed][6])

7. Paradox-of-tolerance overreach
   Popper’s caution about *protecting* liberal orders from violent intolerance gets stretched into a warrant for broad speech suppression. The original is narrower: deny tolerance when intolerance threatens the system itself. ([Wikipedia][7])

8. Unfalsifiable guilt / “Kafka-trap” structure
   Frames where denial confirms the charge (e.g., “your pushback proves fragility/complicity”). Critics (including left-leaning ones) argue this violates standards of falsifiability and fair discourse. ([Mirjam Glessmer][8])

9. Intent-versus-impact absolutism
   Prioritizing impact can be morally useful, but making it *the only* lens invites mind-reading and strict liability for offense. The microaggression literature highlights impact; critics urge *both* intent and impact to guide remedies. ([Life Lessons][9])

10. Empathy over judgment (your “shallow empathy”)
    As Paul Bloom argues, empathy is narrow and biased; it can misdirect justice toward salient offenders/victims and away from impartial rules and consequences. Favor steady compassion + principled rules. ([Vox][10])

11. Redefining “racism” as “prejudice + power” (R = P + P)
    A valid institutional lens—but when treated as *the* definition, it erases interpersonal racism by minorities and fuels talking-past-each-other debates. Know which definition you’re using and why. ([Wikipedia][11])

12. “Outcome-gap proves racism” policy corollary
    Some anti-racist frameworks treat disparities as inherently racist *unless* proved otherwise (e.g., Kendi’s equity-first definitions), which critics say flips the burden of proof and risks endorsing present discrimination to cure past discrimination. ([Penguin][12])
