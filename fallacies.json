      "description": "The simultaneous assertion that certain groups (particularly women) are fully autonomous agents whose choices must be respected, except when those choices involve relationships with people in positions of power or authority‚Äîat which point their agency is retroactively denied and they're treated as incapable of genuine consent. This creates a paradox where the same person is both empowered and powerless depending on which narrative is more politically convenient. Power differentials become an automatic nullification of consent, regardless of actual circumstances.",
      "example": "\"We must believe women and respect their choices‚Äîexcept when a woman chooses to date her professor/boss/mentor, in which case she was obviously manipulated and groomed.\" An adult woman in her 30s dating a CEO is treated as a victim incapable of consent, while simultaneously being celebrated as an empowered professional. Claiming any relationship with a power differential is inherently exploitative, which would invalidate most relationships.",

This treats justice as a zero-sum game where historical wrongs create a moral license for contemporary wrongs in the opposite direction. It abandons individual justice in favor of collective score-settling, where innocent individuals can be sacrificed as 'acceptable losses' in service of a larger social cause. Each person's right to fair treatment is subordinated to group-level historical accounting.",

      "description": "Framing present injustices against a formerly advantaged group as a natural, inevitable, or even desirable 'pendulum swing' or 'course correction' after historical injustices. This naturalizes revenge and overcorrection by treating them as automatic forces of nature or history rather than human choices that can and should be evaluated morally. It suggests that injustice is cyclical and self-correcting, so we should passively accept current wrongs as part of an organic balancing process. By invoking metaphors of nature or cosmic justice, it removes human agency and moral responsibility.",
      "example": "\"Men dominated for centuries, so now it's women's turn‚Äîthe pendulum is just swinging back.\" \"White people had their time in power, now it's natural that they'll experience what minorities experienced.\" \"This is just the pendulum swinging‚Äîit'll eventually find balance in the middle.\" \"You can't stop the pendulum; history always overcorrects before finding equilibrium.\"",

This treats discomfort as harm and disagreement as danger, leading to the suppression of ideas not because they're false but because they make people uncomfortable. It assumes that protecting feelings is more important than discovering truth, and that exposure to challenging ideas is a form of violence rather than an essential part of learning and growth.",

      "description": "Woke ideology treats all culture as irrelevant except that of the dominant culture. Structure cannot explain the behavior of the dominant class because the dominant class is at the top of the food chain. The only other explanation for how the dominant class behaves is culture. The woke do think it's perfectly legitimate and even imperative to criticize the culture of the oppressor. It's fine, for example, to talk about 'white fragility' or 'toxic masculinity'‚Äîthe machismo culture of cis-men‚Äîor 'rape culture.' But how can culture not be a factor at all for marginalized groups but be the sole factor for dominant groups? Are they really saying when structure comes to play culture goes away?",
      "example": "Attributing negative behaviors of white people or men to their culture ('toxic masculinity,' 'white fragility,' 'Karen behavior') while simultaneously insisting that cultural explanations for outcomes among marginalized groups are racist or sexist.

Wouldn't all culture be its creation, and not just the undesirable parts? This is the logical conclusion of this kind of thinking, and it is what happens when you cede omnipotence to the oppressor. When you create a puppet master, you create puppets missing some of the most basic attributes of being human.'",

Many White Americans are, in fact, doing poorly. In addition, some African immigrant groups that came to the U.S. under disadvantageous conditions have on average done better than American blacks and segments of the Hispanic population.
