      "example": "\"Women earn 77 cents on the dollar compared to men, therefore employers are discriminating.\" This ignores factors like hours worked, career choices, experience levels, and personal preferences that contribute to wage differences.",

Personal experience should be used as data, not as the final decider.",

This rhetorical maneuver was named by philosopher Nicholas Shackel.",

      "tagline": "Disguising accusations as unchallengeable feelings",
      "description": "Using past-tense verbs as feelings (e.g., 'I feel violated,' 'I feel attacked,' 'I feel erased') transforms factual claims or accusations into subjective emotional states. This linguistic move makes the statement unfalsifiable‚Äîsince feelings are personal and subjective, they cannot be questioned or disputed. What is actually an accusation that someone did something wrong becomes reframed as merely reporting an internal emotional state.",
      "example": "\"I feel violated by your comment\" instead of \"Your comment violated my boundaries.\" The first formulation presents an accusation as an unchallengeable feeling, while the second makes a disputable claim about what actually happened. Similarly, \"I feel attacked\" avoids having to prove that an attack occurred.",

      "description": "A term coined by evolutionary psychologist Gad Saad describing when our emotional system is hijacked into an excessive, indiscriminate form of empathy that undermines rational cost-benefit analysis and self-preservation. Evolution designed empathy to be strategic and calibrated‚Äîwe naturally prioritize those closest to us. Suicidal empathy occurs when this system malfunctions, leading to policies that harm the in-group while benefiting out-groups or bad actors, all in the name of compassion.",
      "example": "Providing illegal immigrants with more resources and benefits than homeless veterans or disaster victims. Allowing biological males to compete in women's sports because of empathy for trans individuals, while ignoring the rights and safety of biological women. Refusing to enforce immigration laws or criminal penalties out of empathy for offenders, while disregarding victims and law-abiding citizens.",
